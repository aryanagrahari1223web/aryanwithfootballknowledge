<font size="5" color="yellow">The India national football team represents India in international football and is governed by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The team is affiliated to FIFA and Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

Indian team, which was once considered one of the best teams in Asia, had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s.[13] During this period, India won gold at the 1951 and 1962 Asian Games, while finishing fourth at the 1956 Summer Olympics.[14] Thus, India became the first Asian nation to reach the semi-final of a FIFA organised major tournament. India has never participated in the FIFA World Cup, although they did qualify by default for the 1950 FIFA World Cup of Brazil after all other nations in their qualification group withdrew. However, India withdrew prior to the beginning of the tournament due to unspecified reasons.[15] The India national football team is arguably the strongest team in South Asia, it has appeared four times in the AFC Asian Cup, Asia's top football championship, and finished as runners-up once in 1964. India regularly participates in the SAFF Championship, the top football tournament in South Asia. It has won this tournament record eight times since its inception in 1993, thus India is the most successful team in the region</font><br><br><br><br><font size="4" color="red"><center>thanks for visiting</center></font>
